## Key Changes from Original Plan

1. **Geographic Accuracy**: All locations now match REAL California geography
2. **Map Sizing**: Fixed wasted space, added fullscreen with zoom/pan
3. **Discovery System**: Major cities hidden until discovered
4. **Real Roads**: Based on actual California highways (I-5, Highway 1, etc.)
5. **Local Combat**: 10 unique locations near Player Settlement
6. **Interactive**: Click roads/cities for detailed info panels
7. **Mobile Support**: Touch controls, responsive sizing
8. **Lore Accurate**: Pre-war buildings, faction outposts match Fallout canon

## AI Notes

**For future AI context**:
- This is a complete rewrite of the map system from Mojave to California NCR region
- All locations now use percentage-based coordinates (0-100% x,y)
- Travel is road-based, not straight-line
- 500-mile x 500-mile map area, Shady Sands at center
- Road network is graph-based with weighted edges
- Combat missions have 4 phases with road-based travel
- Visual design matches Google Maps dark theme from reference image
- Player settlement is ~50 miles from Shady Sands (not in Shady Sands itself)
