- ✅ Combat locations: Raider camps, Deathclaw territories, mutant strongholds
- ✅ All locations have accurate coordinates, distances from Shady Sands, danger levels
- ✅ Terrain types and connected roads defined

### CaliforniaRoads.ts ✅
- ✅ Complete road network with 40+ segments
- ✅ Interstate 5 (north-south main artery)
- ✅ Highway 99 (parallel route)
- ✅ Interstate 80 (east-west)
- ✅ Old Route 66 (to New Vegas)
- ✅ Highway 101 (coastal)
- ✅ Interstate 15 (northeast)
- ✅ Road conditions: good/damaged/dangerous
- ✅ Distance calculations accurate
- ✅ Danger levels and encounter chances

### Type Updates ✅
- ✅ Extended Mission interface with route tracking
- ✅ Added road-based travel fields
- ✅ Route and path structures defined

## Phase 2: Travel System ✅ COMPLETE

### CaliforniaTravelSystem.ts ✅
- ✅ Road-based distance calculation
- ✅ Travel time calculation with multiple modifiers
- ✅ Route finding (shortest/safest paths)
- ✅ Multi-segment route support
- ✅ Travel speed based on road conditions
- ✅ Squad efficiency modifiers
- ✅ Vehicle type support (foot/vehicle)
- ✅ Weather and time-of-day modifiers
- ✅ Encounter chance calculation per mile

### RoutePathfinder.ts ✅
- ✅ Graph-based pathfinding algorithm
- ✅ Builds road network graph
- ✅ Dijkstra's algorithm implementation
- ✅ Supports multiple route preferences (fast/safe)
- ✅ Returns complete route with segments
- ✅ Total distance and time calculations
- ✅ Danger rating for routes

### EnhancedTravelCalculator.ts ✅
- ✅ Updated to use CaliforniaTravelSystem
- ✅ Fallback for legacy locations
- ✅ Maintains compatibility

## Phase 3: Map Visualization ✅ COMPLETE

### CaliforniaWastelandMap.tsx ✅
- ✅ Core component structure
- ✅ Google Maps dark theme styling (#1a1a1a background)
- ✅ Location rendering with custom markers
- ✅ Color-coded markers by type (settlement/vault/combat)
- ✅ Interactive location selection
- ✅ Real-time squad position tracking
- ✅ Route highlighting support
- ✅ Hover info panels for locations
- ✅ Map legend with location types
- ✅ Distance and danger level display

### RoadRenderer.tsx ✅
- ✅ SVG-based road rendering
- ✅ Condition-based styling (good/damaged/dangerous)
- ✅ Color coding: green=good, amber=damaged, red=dangerous
- ✅ Road width based on type (interstate/highway/minor)
- ✅ Glow effects for active/hovered roads
- ✅ Route highlighting for active missions
- ✅ Hover effects with wider hitbox
- ✅ Road labels and distance display on hover
- ✅ Dashed lines for damaged/dangerous roads

## Phase 4: Integration 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### CombatOperationsMap.tsx ✅
- ✅ Updated to use CaliforniaWastelandMap
- ✅ Real-time squad position tracking
- ✅ Progress display (0-100%)
- ✅ Phase indicators (Travel/Setup/Combat/Return)
- ✅ Location details panel with distance and terrain
- ✅ Removed old Mojave map references

### CaliforniaCombatTargets.ts ✅
- ✅ Dynamic combat target generation from locations
- ✅ Faction-based enemy generation (raiders/mutants/ghouls/deathclaws/etc)
- ✅ Difficulty scaling based on danger level
- ✅ Distance-based rewards calculation
- ✅ Loot pool generation per faction
- ✅ Enemy count and stats based on difficulty

### Combat.tsx ⏳
- ⏳ Update to use CaliforniaCombatTargets
- ⏳ Use CaliforniaTravelSystem for mission planning
- ⏳ Calculate routes before mission starts
- ⏳ Store route in mission data
- ⏳ Track progress along route segments
- ⏳ Random encounters on dangerous roads

### gameReducer.ts ⏳
- ⏳ Add route tracking to mission state
- ⏳ Update mission progress to track road segments
- ⏳ Store current segment and progress
- ⏳ Handle route-based mission completion

## Testing & Refinement ⏳

- ⏳ Verify all distances are accurate
- ⏳ Test route finding with various start/end points
- ⏳ Ensure map styling matches reference image
- ⏳ Test squad movement animation
- ⏳ Verify combat phase transitions
- ⏳ Test with different screen sizes
- ⏳ Performance optimization for road rendering

## Known Issues

None yet - implementation just started.

## Next Steps

1. Complete CaliforniaWastelandMap.tsx distance markers
2. Add combat phase indicators to map
3. Integrate CaliforniaWastelandMap into CombatOperationsMap.tsx
4. Update Combat.tsx to use road-based travel
5. Update gameReducer.ts for route tracking
6. Full end-to-end testing

## AI Notes

**For future AI context**:
- This is a complete rewrite of the map system from Mojave to California NCR region
- All locations now use percentage-based coordinates (0-100% x,y)
- Travel is road-based, not straight-line
- 500-mile x 500-mile map area, Shady Sands at center
- Road network is graph-based with weighted edges
- Combat missions have 4 phases with road-based travel
- Visual design matches Google Maps dark theme from reference image
- Player settlement is ~50 miles from Shady Sands (not in Shady Sands itself)
