## üéØ Key Improvements

### 1. **Accurate Scaling**
**Before**: Player Outpost ~50 miles from Shady Sands  
**After**: Player Outpost **185 miles** from Shady Sands

All distances now match real California geography adapted for Fallout.

### 2. **Consistent Coordinate System**
**Before**: Mixed pixel and percentage coordinates  
**After**: Pure percentage system (0-100) across all components

This means:
- Easy to position new locations
- Minimap and fullscreen use same data
- No conversion math needed
- Scales perfectly to any display size

### 3. **Accurate Geography**
All locations positioned based on actual Fallout 1/2 map:
- **Northern California**: Redding, New Reno, San Francisco
- **Central California**: Shady Sands (NCR), Vault 13, Gecko
- **Southern California**: Boneyard (LA), Necropolis, Dayglow (SD)
- **Eastern Frontier**: New Vegas in Mojave

### 4. **Realistic Road Network**
- **Interstate highways** (I-5, I-15, I-80)
- **State highways** (Hwy 99, Hwy 101)
- **Local roads** connecting combat zones
- Bezier curves for realistic road shapes
- Proper distances and travel times

### 5. **Visual Enhancements**
- Dark Google Maps aesthetic (#1a1a1a background)
- Glow effects for major cities
- Color-coded road types
- Smooth hover effects
- Squad movement tracking
- Distance labels
- Danger level indicators

## üìê New Coordinate System

### How It Works
```
Map Coverage: 800 miles (N-S) √ó 400 miles (E-W)
Coordinates: Percentage (0-100 for both X and Y)

X-axis Scale: 1% = ~4 miles
Y-axis Scale: 1% = ~8 miles

Center Point: Shady Sands at (35, 50)
```

### Example Coordinates
```typescript
Shady Sands:     (35, 50)  // Center - NCR Capital
Player Outpost:  (15, 72)  // SW Coast - 185 miles away
San Francisco:   (12, 48)  // NW Coast - 205 miles
New Vegas:       (88, 64)  // Far East - 380 miles
Boneyard (LA):   (22, 84)  // South - 285 miles
```

### Distance Formula
```javascript
deltaX = Math.abs(loc2.x - loc1.x) * 4;  // miles
deltaY = Math.abs(loc2.y - loc1.y) * 8;  // miles
distance = Math.sqrt(deltaX¬≤ + deltaY¬≤);
```

## üé® Visual Style Guide

### Location Markers
- **Settlement** (purple): Major towns and cities
- **Vault** (cyan): Vault-Tec facilities
- **Facility** (red): Military/industrial sites
- **Combat Zone** (amber): Hostile areas
- **Outpost** (green): Friendly settlements
- **Player Base** (bright green): Your outpost

### Marker Sizes
- **Player Outpost**: 1.4 (largest)
- **Settlements**: 1.2
- **Vaults/Facilities**: 1.0
- **Combat Zones**: 0.8 (smallest)

### Road Colors
- **Interstate** (yellow/amber): #f59e0b
- **Highway** (orange): #fb923c
- **Minor** (brown): #92400e

### Road Widths
- **Interstate**: 0.4px (thickest)
- **Highway**: 0.3px
- **Minor**: 0.2px (thinnest)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the New System

### Adding a New Location
1. Choose coordinates using the reference map
2. Calculate distance from Shady Sands
3. Add to `CaliforniaLocations.ts`
4. Create connecting road in `CaliforniaRoads.ts`
5. Test in-game

### Moving a Location
1. Update `coordinates` in `CaliforniaLocations.ts`
2. Recalculate `distanceFromShadySands`
3. Update any affected roads

### Adding a Road

## üéì Learning Resources

### Understanding Coordinates
- X = 0 (far west) to 100 (far east)
- Y = 0 (far north) to 100 (far south)
- Shady Sands at (35, 50) is center reference

### Distance Math
```
Horizontal distance: ŒîX * 4 miles
Vertical distance: ŒîY * 8 miles
Total distance: ‚àö(h¬≤ + v¬≤)
```

### Road Curves
```typescript
// Straight road
curveControlPoints: []

// Gentle curve
curveControlPoints: [{ x: 40, y: 50 }]

// S-curve
curveControlPoints: [{ x: 40, y: 45 }, { x: 48, y: 52 }]
```
